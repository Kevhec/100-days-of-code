# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the challenge, did a frontEndMentor challenge *linked below*, started new project for JS course, created some readme files for my repos.

**Thoughts:** Today is a special day due to my commitment with [100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com) challenge. I also did one small component for frontEndMentor that was kind of challenging because of my lack of experience positioning elements in the background. Finally, I started a new project for my JavaScript course.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
