# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 29, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Fixed a bug on my personal project "Songscape" and started skeleton views for loading states, studied more rust concepts!

**Thoughts:** It was a constructive day. Read about skeleton views for loading states to apply then on my NextJS project called "songscape", also fixed a bug on my API that was crashing my build. In addition to this, I practiced RUST by solving exercises about Strings and Arrays. This process of learning rust has taught me a lot of concepts that have helped me a lot in my understanding of programming logic.
