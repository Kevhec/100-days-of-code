# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: January 27, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Some CSS and JS readings and small advance on café project.

**Thoughts:** Today I read a CSS Trick's article about color schemes, it was really interesting! Also read some info on MDN about map objects in JavaScript! Finally, I did some small advances on the café project that I presented in yesterday's log.

### Day 6: January 6, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Small frontEndMentor challenge and finished validation system for old e-commerce project.

**Thoughts:** What can I say, today was a quiet day, did not do a lot but it was nice to make an easy frontEndMentor challenge and finally having my validation system ready for an old page I made for a CSS project. Links below!

### Day 5: January 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: After a small pause I did three new frontEndMentor challenges.

**Thoughts:** I felt kind of bad due to some difficulties I had with one project that I knew wasn't so hard. I decided to rest a couple of days so I could try again with my mind relaxed and a better frame of mind. Finally I could finish it with ease and also did two more challenges and I'm so happy with the results, so this time I learned that things should be taken with calm, everything by its time, and some times it's ok to have some rest!

### Day 4: January 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started and almost finished (I guess) implementation of validations on old project form.

**Thoughts:** As said on yesterday's log, my goal today was to start the implementation of a validation system for an old project for a CSS course. It's a begginer level project but I'm happy for been capable of doing it as these are my first steps with JavaScript.
I did a big advance today with my undertanding of the language and the project is working as I wanted. Today I will finish it as are still missing some specific checks for unrequired inputs. I'll leave a link to the project's repository and live site below!

### Day 3: January 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Another frontEndMentor challenge!

**Thoughts:** Today's challenge was a relief one not as the yesterday one wich was pretty challenging. But as every project I do for the platform It was filled with new learnings. This time I used the *background-repeat* porperty to save some lines for my html and I really liked the results, take a look to the challenge's README in it's repo linked below!
Tomorrow my goal is to start the implementation of a recently learned JavaScript feature. It consists in the validation of forms. I'm specially interested in reading some documentations of regular expressions to validate things like e-mail structure or password required elements!

### Day 2: December 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did new frontEndMentor challenge.

**Thoughts:** Today's challenge was pretty challenging for me, specially for some positioning issues I had but I managed to complete it! Now I'm aware of my lack of experience with positioning so my new goal is to get a better understanding of it.

### Day 1: December 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished JS course's second project.

**Thoughts:** The project in question is an Email creation form simulator. The goal with this project was to validate if entries were correct for the specific field, in adition to a validation of required and non required fields. My goal is to put on practice the new learnings adding the same validations to an existing project of mine from another course *(linked below)*. This journey is starting pretty good!

### Day 0: December 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the challenge, did a frontEndMentor challenge *(linked below)*, started new project for JS course, created some readme files for my repos.

**Thoughts:** Today is a special day due to my commitment with [100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com) challenge. I also did one small component for frontEndMentor that was kind of challenging because of my lack of experience positioning elements in the background. Finally, I started a new project for my JavaScript course.
