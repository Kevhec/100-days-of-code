# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 29, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Fixed a bug on my personal project "Songscape" and started skeleton views for loading states, studied more rust concepts!

**Thoughts:** It was a constructive day. Read about skeleton views for loading states to apply then on my NextJS project called "songscape", also fixed a bug on my API that was crashing my build. In addition to this, I practiced RUST by solving exercises about Strings and Arrays. This process of learning rust has taught me a lot of concepts that have helped me a lot in my understanding of programming logic.

### Day 1: September 30, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Finished skeleton layout for artist card, added responsive design and refactored some scss

**Thoughts:** Today I finished the skeleton layout for the artist card with animations and proper placeholders for every dynamic element of the card, also provided a responsive design to match my figma. Added some utility classes and refactored some scss to avoid magic numbers.

### Day 2: October 1, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Added typography, heading and fav button components. Also started top tracks api call.

**Thoughts:** The day was pretty educational. Practiced css animations for my fav button component, added a typography component that's going to save me time on the future and a heading component that's recurrent on the entire project. Also started checking the api call to get the top tracks chart and read some typescript docs.

### Day 3: October 2, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Created tracks component, added top tracks api route.

**Thoughts:** Today the coding was not the main act, it was the docs reading process to check my external api services to achieve my goals for songscape. Found useful information and pretty nice endpoints. Tomorrow the development process will be full of learning with this new knowledge!

### Day 4: October 3, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Advanced on tracks and cover arts api endpoint.

**Thoughts:** Today I spent most of the time working on getting the cover art pictures for my tracks, endpoint that will be useful on future components, it's getting tough but the new knowledge is worth it!
