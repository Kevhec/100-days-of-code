# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started the challenge, did a frontEndMentor challenge *(linked below)*, started new project for JS course, created some readme files for my repos.

**Thoughts:** Today is a special day due to my commitment with [100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com) challenge. I also did one small component for frontEndMentor that was kind of challenging because of my lack of experience positioning elements in the background. Finally, I started a new project for my JavaScript course.

### Day 1: December 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished JS course's second project.

**Thoughts:** The project in question is an Email creation form simulator. The goal with this project was to validate if entries were correct for the specific field, in adition to a validation of required and non required fields. My goal is to put on practice the new learnings adding the same validations to an existing project of mine from another course *(linked below)*. This journey is starting pretty good!
